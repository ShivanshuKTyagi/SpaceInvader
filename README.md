# SpaceInvader
Space Invader game implemented using core opengl and c++, coded in CodeBlocks.

*Compiled game can be found in bin folder*
*just run it with the dll file provided in the same folder(workd for 32 bits)*

//CodeBlocks was used to code this project in a 32 bit PC//
it is a game created by me in oct 2018. at that i was just a beginner and hence code quality is bad. so sorry in advance.
It was a project for fun because i was getting bored at home during midsem break of first sem.
I used OpenGL Library and C++ to code with no external rendering library, hence the quality of graphics is of 80s.

*difficulity can be adjusted by changing the index variable, it increases the speed of the falling objects*
